# Scripts

This directory contains all submitted scripts for the Keyer store.

Scripts are automatically downloaded and stored here when submitted through GitHub issues.

## File Naming Convention

Scripts are named using the pattern: `{name}{extension}`

Where:
- `{name}` is the `name` field from package.json
- `{extension}` is the original file extension (`.sh`, `.js`, `.py`, etc.)

## Example

For a script with `name: "finder-to-terminal"` and main file `index.sh`:
- File path: `scripts/finder-to-terminal.sh`
- Metadata in `app.json`

## Usage

Users can download scripts directly from this directory or use the Keyer app to install them.
